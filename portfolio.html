          <p>Hi so this is my biggest achievement when I was in senior i never 
            thought that I'll be one of those students who'll be called in front because they're honors so 
            for me as a student who don't really like studying or learning by my own is a big achievement for 
            me because even if I'm lazy I still manage to achieve this wonderful achievement.</p>
            <p>Through the months and days that I manage to stay positive when it comes to the lessons and 
              quizzes so I've learned a lot of things such as in coding and specially by doing a website like 
              this is not easy for me because I don't know what to do but thankfully that our sir let us group into 4 
              and it makes easier for us to complete the task and also I've learned alot in C language I might not that 
              good but I still manage to get enough lessons to understand some of its process's and what do I need to work the code.</p>
