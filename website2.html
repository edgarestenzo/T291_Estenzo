            but with hardwork and perserverance I coup up and learn the method of it. It challenge also my patience and got easily irritated LOL.

        <p>What I learned in IT 113 IT FUNDAMENTAL. I was able to know how Human and Computer interaction works and how does technologies can be addictive to the
           users, this can also make them feel embarrassed or even lost of excitement about the website depends on how the website has and it's design. The highlights 
           of this lesson that I will always remember will be on how to deal with your website according to the specific users that you want to use to the website you are 
           making and it should also have a good quality of design that won't make your website bored and too much colors of your website because this could lead to the user's
            interest on your website lost because of its design and also by making sure that the button should be a user friendly not that hard to understand is one of the best 
            website that I should make to make any user comfortable whenever they use the website that I created and also this made the biggest challenged that I encountered on 
            my previous majors because I'm new on making a website but still I'm doing my best to cope up and make a good website that the users will love</p>
